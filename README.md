# ReactionTesterProject
A project Based on HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT which test the reaction of the player playing the game.It counts the time take for the each reaction delay
In this project there are many shape apppear at random places and random shape and user have to click on the shapes as they appeared.And as clicked on the page you got the time taken to click 
click on the shape.Hence,this way you saw your time to react on a shape .this is the main motto of this project.
It just an assumption on the basis of the "SNAKE GAME PLAYED AT KEYPAD NOKIA MOBILE"  where snake eat balls on your reaction of movement on buttons and got large .A quite bit same as that game.
